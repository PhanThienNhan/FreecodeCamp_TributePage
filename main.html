                                <p>Pham Quoc Viet, born in 1987, hails from Nam Dinh, and currently resides and works in Hanoi. He is the founder of FAS Angel (First Aid Support Angel), an organization dedicated to providing first aid assistance.</p>

                            <li>
                                <p>The establishment of the team stemmed from Pham Quoc Viet's feelings of loneliness and abandonment after he was involved in a traffic accident in Tuyen Quang in 2016. Subsequently, Viet was determined to apply the first aid knowledge he had learned during his military service to begin a journey of assisting those in need on the streets of the capital city.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Up to now, on average, the FAS Angel team has carried out over 1,000 first aid cases per year, including approximately 600 traffic accidents of varying severity.</p>

I will nurture, care for, maintain, and develop it, especially dedicating FAS Angel to future generations. I will definitely do this because there are more and more passionate volunteers every day, ready to share the joys and sorrows with me, no longer like in 2017 - when I had to go out alone to rescue people."</p>

                            <li>
                                <p>Ms. Nguyen Thi Ha graduated with a Bachelor's degree in English pedagogy from the University of Languages and International Studies, Hanoi National University in 2004. In the same year, she began working at Phan Dinh Giot High School.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>In 2016, Ms. Ha became the Deputy Secretary of the school's youth union alongside her professional duties. This marked the beginning of her involvement in volunteer work, providing support and assistance to students in difficult circumstances.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>In order to support and assist a greater number of students in difficult circumstances, Ms. Ha and the teachers at Phan Dinh Giot High School established a "zero-dong supermarket" booth. Here, compassionate individuals, neighbors, colleagues, etc., have contributed whatever they can, from old/new clothes to household items, to offer aid.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    In addition to students in remote areas, Ms. Ha has also provided assistance to many cases near the city. One such case is Tran Dinh An Na, a student in class 6A1 at Thanh Luong Secondary School, who comes from extremely difficult circumstances. Her mother suffers from scleroderma (a rare and incurable disease worldwide), leaving her unable to work. Na's younger sister has lymphoma, and the family lacks the financial means to afford her treatment.
                                    During a visit to Na's family, her mother recognized Ms. Ha as her former teacher. The two embraced each other in tears, never expecting to reunite under such circumstances.
                                    True to Ms. Ha's promise, Na's family regularly receives gifts from the connections she has made with kind-hearted individuals.

                    <ul class="history">
                            <li>
                                <p>After completing a two-year primary education pedagogy program, fueled by her love for children and her independence from a young age, Tra Thi Thu persuaded her family and wrote a letter to the Nam Tra My district, Quang Nam province, to turn her childhood dream into reality.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    In that small school, with its clear-eyed children and meager command of the Vietnamese language, Tra Thi Thu faced 40 students with worn faces. Initially, during the day, she spoke her part, while the students spoke theirs. At night, the young teacher wiped away tears of fear, loneliness, and homesickness that never seemed to fade.
                                    The unimaginable difficulties made Thu briefly consider leaving her beloved job. However, day after day, the hesitant reading voices of the kind-hearted children from the highlands, the purity they exuded, and the warmth of the villagers' support, all kept the young teacher grounded.                                
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    When introduced to volunteer teachers at the school, Tra Thi Thu joined the Love Connection Club in Nam Tra My district. From there, her newfound passion for volunteer trips on holidays helped her learn how to directly mobilize support and aid for students and local residents at the teaching site.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    For nine months, Tra Thi Thu provided loving care for students, ensuring they received nutritious meals. She also organized over 300 aid packages for local residents, totaling over 120 million VND. These achievements were made possible through her efforts. Additionally, she personally volunteered to help disadvantaged residents in her district for over 20 days, directly cooking meals and providing milk for the students.
                                </p>

                                    During the 2017-2018 academic year, Ms. Tra Thi Thu taught at the Mo Roi school site. She continued her efforts by mobilizing 540 daily meals for 10 students who stayed at school, providing 72 nutritious meals for all students, distributing 50 crates of milk, and offering over 300 aid packages to local residents, totaling 174 million VND.                                
                                </P>
                                <P>
                                    In addition, Ms. Thu went above and beyond by providing all necessary conditions and personally caring for 10 young children, aged 3 to 6, from distant homes, allowing them to stay and study at the school throughout the week. Balancing her role as a teacher and a nurturing mother figure, she took care of these children, ensuring they had not only meals and rest but also comforting them when they fell ill or felt homesick.

To date, the project has organized 5 waste clean-up events and planted over 100,000 trees, with a total implementation cost of nearly 1 billion VND.

                                    After participating in environmental protection campaigns, Nguyen Truong Giang (born in 2005), a student at the Vietnam - Korea Vocational College (Cà Mau), mobilized classmates to form a group to clean up parks, bus stations, school gates, temples, and pagodas. They shared images of their activities on the social media platform Facebook. Initially, the group consisted of about a dozen people, but gradually more young people in the city joined. To formalize their activities, at the end of 2022, Giang founded the Green Grasshopper Club.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Currently, the club has 72 members and over 100 volunteers from both within and outside the province, mainly students aged 15 to 20. Giang has built and organized multiple teams, including a "grasshopper" team to survey and hunt for litter black spots, as well as establishing a hotline to receive information from the public with the motto "if there's trash, let's handle it."  
                                </p>

                                    In April 2023, the club became a member of the Vietnam Youth Union in Cà Mau City. This facilitated more favorable conditions for the club to connect and implement activities, eradicating more litter black spots. Moreover, from this point, the club's activities spread further, attracting more young people and residents to participate.

                                    To raise funds, the Green Grasshopper Club organized recycling activities to turn plastic waste into handmade products. Each week, the club produces 15 to 20 items such as trash cans, pen holders, flower pots, etc., from recycled materials. Through the channels of the Youth Union and other organizations, the recycled products made by these "green grasshoppers" are in high demand.

                                    Since its establishment, the Green Grasshopper Club has organized over 70 independent activities and participated in coordinating 45 additional activities. Through these efforts, the club has collected and processed over 40 tons of waste, including more than 15 tons of plastic waste.

                                    Duc Cuong worked as a beach cleaner in Ha Long City for 7 years. During this challenging time, Đen Vâu took unpaid leave to support his younger brother's coffee shop business as a means of livelihood. Unfortunately, the coffee shop incurred losses, leading Đen Vâu to return to work to cover expenses in hopes of sustaining the business. However, the shop officially closed its doors in 2016. After paying off the debt, Đen Vâu wrote the song "Ngày Lang Thang" (Wandering Days) - a milestone reflecting his positive mindset.                                </li>

                                    In 2023, Đen Vâu spread awareness and called for community support through the music video "Nấu Ăn Cho Em" (Cooking for You), as part of the "Nuôi Em" (Feed Them) project. This initiative raised over 1 billion VND to provide nutritious meals for over 30,000 students in remote areas.                                    </p>

                                    In the final days of the year, despite being busy with work, Ms. Trang still managed to allocate time to consolidate the support funds from benefactors to send to the coordinating units for the implementation of the "Building Schools - Building Dreams" project number 2 in Suoi Ngang village, Quang Huy commune, Phu Yen district, Son La province. The project is scheduled to be inaugurated at the end of January 2024 with a total budget of over 400 million VND, of which Ms. Trang alone mobilized contributions totaling 187.8 million VND. This is also the project with the largest budget mobilized by Ms. Trang in 2023.

                                    Furthermore, this year, Ms. Trang participated in calling for support for 19 charity programs to assist those in particularly difficult circumstances both within and outside the province, providing gifts, cash, etc., with a total value of nearly 334 million VND.

                                    Accordingly, Ms. Trang's charity activities mainly involve connecting with benevolent individuals to support various initiatives such as visiting and giving gifts to poor children in remote and disadvantaged areas, providing funeral assistance, covering medical expenses for those in extremely difficult circumstances, building houses of love, schools, etc., in impoverished regions both within and outside the province. On average, Ms. Trang mobilizes organizations for charity activities with a total budget ranging from 300 to 500 million VND per year.

                                    For each charity program, Ms. Trang meticulously conducts surveys, researches, and verifies the beneficiaries to ensure that the charitable work reaches the right people and serves the right purposes. She also connects with various volunteer groups across the country through multiple channels to facilitate timely and effective support.

                                    Recognizing that mobilizing and supporting charity work solely with good intentions but without proper transparency can lead to suspicion and controversy, Ms. Trang always exercises caution and transparency in openly disclosing information about the beneficiaries, the amount of money, gifts, and the identities of the benevolent individuals who support her initiatives on her personal social media page immediately after completing the work. This helps to build trust and confidence among philanthropists, ensuring the sustainability of charity activities.

                        Ms. Trang shared: "My journey into volunteer activities felt very natural, sparked by a moment while watching TV where I saw images of children in Binh Lieu without warm clothes amidst the harsh cold weather in the highlands. Therefore, I had the idea to collect and donate gently used clothes from acquaintances, friends, along with essential necessities to give to these children. After a few calls for donations and delivering love, I noticed many of my friends were enthusiastic about participating in volunteer activities, but lacked connections, so I continued to support, connect information, and carry out these actions. From there, my good deeds began to spread."

                                    Mrs. Nguyễn Thị Ánh Tuyết currently serves as the chairwoman of the Women's Club of Former Female Soldiers in Tan Binh District, the Secretary of the Party Cell of Block 3 (Ward 8), the President of the Scholarships Promotion Association of Ward 8, the Deputy Head of the Women's Union Team 29, Block 3, Ward 8, Tan Binh District. When asked about what led her to engage in social work and volunteer activities, she kindly responded, "I don't remember exactly when it started, perhaps it's partly due to my family's tradition. When I joined the work in Tan Binh District, I saw many people facing difficulties in life. With comradery and solidarity, inheriting the tradition of Uncle Ho's soldiers, implementing the motto 'where there are women, there are activities of the Women's Union', I, along with other sisters and mothers in the Women's Club of Former Female Soldiers in Tan Binh District, the Women's Union of Ward 8, wanted to contribute together with the Party Committee, the Veterans' Association, and the Women's Union of the district to care for and help improve the lives of poor members in the district."                                </p>

                                    In 2022, Ms. Nguyễn Thị Ánh Tuyết, along with the Executive Board of the Women's Club, the Party Cell, and the Women's Union Team 29, Block 3, Ward 8, mobilized philanthropists to support the construction of 01 charity house in Ward 10 with a budget of 50 million Vietnamese dong. During the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ho Chi Minh City, when the entire city had to implement social distancing measures, Ms. Nguyễn Thị Ánh Tuyết, along with her comrades and sisters in the Women's Union, the Fatherland Front Committee of Tan Binh District, mobilized 9 tons of rice, along with other necessities such as clothing, and cash donations to be given to the Blind Association and people facing difficulties due to the social distancing measures and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.                                </p>

                                    Besides her community work, Ms. Nguyễn Thị Ánh Tuyết is affectionately called "má Tuyết" ("Mother Tuyết"). It is known that within her family, all of her children and grandchildren have been well-fed and educated. Because of this, she also pays great attention to educational activities in the locality. "Má Tuyết" does an excellent job in mobilizing scholarships for poor students. Though this task might not seem significant, it's not easy to accomplish. Only through active mobilization does one truly understand that even though it's a humanitarian activity for future generations, it's not always easy to get support. However, with the support of the Party Committee, government authorities, and the various departments and organizations of Ward 8, as well as the assistance of philanthropists, every year scholarships are awarded to deserving students. In 2022, the Scholarship Association distributed 150 gifts to its members (300,000 VND/gift) and awarded 52 scholarships (worth 52 million VND) to students. In 2023, they distributed 60 bicycles worth 50 million VND to students in the district and those from Tra Vinh province.                                </p>

                        Mrs. Tuyet shared, "You don't have to wait until you're rich or have enough to start doing meaningful work or volunteering. If you have the ability to help someone in any way, just do it. Eventually, you'll be rich. And even if you don't become materially wealthy, you'll enrich your heart."                    </p>
