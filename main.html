                            <li>
                                <p>Pham Quoc Viet, born in 1987, hails from Nam Dinh, and currently resides and works in Hanoi. He is the founder of FAS Angel (First Aid Support Angel), an organization dedicated to providing first aid assistance.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>The establishment of the team stemmed from Pham Quoc Viet's feelings of loneliness and abandonment after he was involved in a traffic accident in Tuyen Quang in 2016. Subsequently, Viet was determined to apply the first aid knowledge he had learned during his military service to begin a journey of assisting those in need on the streets of the capital city.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Up to now, on average, the FAS Angel team has carried out over 1,000 first aid cases per year, including approximately 600 traffic accidents of varying severity.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>The contributions of the FAS Angel free first aid support team have been recognized and highly appreciated. The team has been awarded certificates of merit at the National Volunteer Awards and other badges of honor.</p>

                            <li>
                                <p>In the 4th "Initiative for the Community" competition in 2022, Pham Quoc Viet's project "Developing a free first aid support team for the community" was honored to receive the B Prize. </p>

                    <p>The 'orange-shirt heroes' Pham Quoc Viet: "Even if I'm gone, there are still 12 siblings left. FAS Angel always lives to save people! FAS Angel is like my own child. I will nurture, care for, maintain, and develop it, especially dedicating FAS Angel to future generations. I will definitely do this because there are more and more passionate volunteers every day, ready to share the joys and sorrows with me, no longer like in 2017 - when I had to go out alone to rescue people."</p>
